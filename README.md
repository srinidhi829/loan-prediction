Loan prediction uses machine learning to forecast whether a loan applicant is likely to repay or default.
The model is trained on historical data including income, credit history, and employment details.
Algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest classify loan approval status.
This helps financial institutions make faster and data-driven lending decisions.
